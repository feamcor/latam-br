# latam-br

My employer (at November 2015) gave me an HP laptop with an annoying [__Latin American__](http://www.microsoft.com/resources/msdn/goglobal/keyboards/kbdla.html) Spanish keyboard layout that miss the [__C-cedilla__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ç) (Ç) and [__tilde__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilde) (~) characters as used by my mother tongue [__Brazilian Portuguese__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_Portuguese) (pt_BR). Different than the [__Spanish - ISO__](https://www.microsoft.com/resources/msdn/goglobal/keyboards/kbdsp.html) keyboard layout, the Latin American one does not allow you to type such characters not even through the [__alt-gr__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AltGr_key) dead key.

After searching around in the Internet, I could not find a ready solution for that, but I found that Microsoft has a tool called [__Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator__](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/goglobal/bb964665.aspx) (KLC) that allows you to change the mappings of an existing keyboard layout and generate an installer for it.

So, that's it. In this repo you will find the .KLC file that I edited through the KLC tool and also the installer generated by it.

I hope it will save you some time in case you are facing the same problem as I did.

Best Regards.
